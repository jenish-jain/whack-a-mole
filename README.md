# whack-a-mole
a basic whack a mole game - part of newton school assignment

#whack-a-mole v2

The game is now handled by event listeners and can be expanded any time by adding more divs in the index.html section with class="holes" without any change in CSS or javascript.  
also now the game speed increased gradually as you score high and a high score feature has been added.
at the end, an alert is displayed with your score.
and instead of being time-constrained now clicking the wrong hole ends the game.

[scopes of imporvements]

prevent double click on the same hole.
style alert box
